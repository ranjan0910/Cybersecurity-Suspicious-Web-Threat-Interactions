# Cybersecurity: Suspicious Web Threat Interactions
Detect and analyze suspicious activities from web traffic logs using Data Analysis (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This project leverages anomaly detection and classification models to uncover potential cybersecurity threats.
## What's Inside
- Clean the messy log data (timestamps, IPs, bytes, port)
- Visualize traffic — by protocols
- Engineer new features — like session durations and packet patterns
- Detect anomalies — using Isolation Forest
- Classify threats — with Random Forests and Neural Networks
- Plot everything — from simple charts
## Tools & Technology
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
## Key Insight
- Top Suspicious IPs Based on Anomaly Scores
- Suspicious Traffic by Country
- Time-Based Anomaly Detection
- Top Features Contributing to Classification (Random Forest)
